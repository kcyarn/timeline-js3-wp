# Stheno Site Cheatsheet

Thes commands should be run in this order with an actual commit message between the quotes. I don't know if anyone else will ever need this, but felt it best to document such things just in case.

## Generate Hugo Site
    cd stheno_blog
    hugo -t casper

## Generate Index.json from Atom Feed (Index.xml)
This uses (xml2json)[https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/node-xml2json-command].

    cd public
    xml2json < index.xml > index.json

## Github gh-pages-source repo

    git add .
    git commit -m "..."
    git push origin gh-pages-source

## Github gh-pages repo

    cd public
    git add .
    git commit -m "..."
    git push origin gh-pages
    
# Installation Notes

Hugo is divided over two repositories: gh-pages-source and gh-pages. Gh-pages-source houses everything hugo needs to generate the site. Gh-pages houses the contents of the public directory generated by Hugo. Within the stheno_blog directory, a .gitignore file sets the public directory as ignored for gh-pages-source.
